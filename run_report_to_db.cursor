Write a Python script that:
1. Connects to ecom.db
2. Reads the SQL query from report.sql
3. Executes that query
4. Creates a table named report_output and stores the query result there
5. If report_output already exists, drop it and recreate it
6. Print how many rows were inserted

Save the script as run_report_to_db.py in the workspace.
